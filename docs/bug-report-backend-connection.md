# Bug Report: Backend Connection Failure on Vercel Deployment

## Issue Summary
**Date:** September 17, 2024  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Component:** Backend API, Vercel Deployment  

## Problem Description
The hazard analysis application was experiencing "failed to connect to backend" errors when deployed on Vercel. The frontend was working correctly, but all API calls to the backend were failing.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Incorrect Vercel Configuration
- **Issue:** `vercel.json` was trying to use `@vercel/python` with `safety_assistant.py` directly
- **Problem:** Vercel requires a proper WSGI entry point for Python Flask applications
- **Impact:** Backend API endpoints were not accessible

### 2. Wrong Database Implementation
- **Issue:** Code was using Firebase/Firestore instead of Supabase
- **Problem:** Previous deployment had Firebase functions disabled, and code was still referencing Firebase
- **Impact:** Document storage and retrieval functions were failing

### 3. Missing Dependencies
- **Issue:** Required Python packages for Vercel deployment were missing
- **Problem:** `requirements.txt` was incomplete for production deployment
- **Impact:** Import errors and module not found errors

### 4. Frontend API Configuration
- **Issue:** Frontend was hardcoded to use `localhost:5002` in production
- **Problem:** No dynamic API URL detection for production vs development
- **Impact:** API calls were going to wrong endpoints

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Vercel Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Created Proper WSGI Entry Point
**File:** `api/index.py`
```python
from safety_assistant import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### 3. Replaced Firebase with Supabase
- Removed all Firebase/Firestore imports and code
- Implemented proper Supabase client initialization
- Updated all document storage functions to use Supabase tables
- Fixed database queries and data handling

### 4. Updated Dependencies
**File:** `requirements.txt`
```
flask==2.3.3
flask-cors==4.0.0
openai==0.28.1
supabase==2.0.0
PyPDF2==3.0.1
python-docx==0.8.11
gunicorn==21.2.0
requests==2.31.0
```

### 5. Fixed Frontend API Configuration
**File:** `frontend/src/config.js`
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 
  (window.location.hostname === 'localhost' ? 'http://localhost:5002' : '');
```

## Files Modified
- `vercel.json` - Updated build configuration
- `api/index.py` - Created WSGI entry point
- `safety_assistant.py` - Replaced Firebase with Supabase
- `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
- `frontend/src/config.js` - Fixed API URL configuration

## Testing Results
- ✅ Local import test passed
- ✅ Supabase client initialization working
- ✅ All API endpoints properly configured
- ✅ Frontend API routing fixed

## Deployment Status
- **GitHub:** All changes committed and pushed
- **Vercel:** New deployment triggered with latest fixes
- **Status:** Awaiting deployment completion

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these are set in Vercel dashboard:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Next Steps
1. Verify Vercel deployment completed successfully
2. Test hazard analysis functionality
3. Confirm Supabase table `documents` exists
4. Monitor for any remaining issues

## Prevention Measures
1. Always test Vercel configuration before deployment
2. Use proper WSGI entry points for Python apps
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
4. Test both local and production environments
5. Keep dependencies up to date
